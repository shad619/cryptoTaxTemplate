This Excel file is a template to calculate US-based taxes from cryptocurrency transactions.

According to the IRS:
The sale or other exchange of virtual currencies, or the use of virtual currencies to pay for goods or services, or holding virtual currencies as an investment, generally has tax consequences that could result in tax liability.
If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayerâ€™s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable gain.
